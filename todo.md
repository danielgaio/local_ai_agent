1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Make the project work with OpenAI as a model provider.
   - **Implementation**: OpenAI support is fully functional through existing provider infrastructure
   - **Configuration**: Set `MODEL_PROVIDER=openai` and `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` environment variables
   - **Models**: Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo` for LLM and `text-embedding-3-small` for embeddings
   - **Features**: Full support for LLM inference, embeddings generation, vector store, and retriever operations
   - **Testing**: Created `tests/test_openai_integration.py` with 10 comprehensive tests (automatically skipped without API key)
   - **Documentation**: Updated README.md, CLI_USAGE.md, and .env.example with OpenAI configuration instructions

2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Add an integration test that runs with MODEL_PROVIDER=openai (skipped unless OPENAI_API_KEY is available) or a CI matrix item for OpenAI if you want to test both providers automatically.
   - **Implementation**: `tests/test_openai_integration.py` with 10 tests covering all OpenAI functionality
   - **Auto-skip**: Tests use `pytest.mark.skipif` to automatically skip when OPENAI_API_KEY is not set
   - **Coverage**: API key validation, embeddings, LLM initialization/invocation, vector store, retriever, end-to-end flow

3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Add an integration test that runs only when OPENAI_API_KEY is present (skip otherwise) to verify OpenAI end-to-end.
   - **Implementation**: Included in `tests/test_openai_integration.py` with `test_openai_end_to_end_simple()`
   - **Testing**: Verifies complete query flow: retriever initialization, document search, LLM invocation, response parsing
4. Create a script that sets up the environment, installs dependencies, downloads necessary models, and starts the application.
5. Generate a web interface to interact with the agent.
